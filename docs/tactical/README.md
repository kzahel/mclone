# Tactical docs

Numbered, short-lived implementation plans. Each covers a cohesive group of modules scoped to ~1–2 focused sessions of work. Strategy lives in [`../strategy.md`](../strategy.md); these are the sequenced "do this next" plans.

## Rule of thumb

- **Plan only the next one in detail.** What we learn porting module N changes what N+1 should look like.
- The arc below is *aspirational orientation*, not a commitment. Skip, merge, or reorder as reality dictates.
- Each tactical doc owns: scope (modules), unit-oracle inputs → expected outputs, "done when" criteria, and a pointer to the next.

## Arc (aspirational, toward MVP terrain gen)

| Doc | Modules | Oracle tier | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [`00-worldgen-ts-port.md`](00-worldgen-ts-port.md) | scaffold, `SimpleRandomSource`, `WorldgenRandom`, `ImprovedNoise` | unit | foundation numerics |
| [`01-noise-octaves.md`](01-noise-octaves.md) | `PerlinNoise`, `SimplexNoise`, `BlendedNoise` | unit | everything `NoiseSampler` consumes from `synth/` |
| [`02-remaining-synth.md`](02-remaining-synth.md) | `SurfaceNoise`, `PerlinSimplexNoise`, minimal `NormalNoise` | unit | remaining `synth/` pieces alive in default 1.17.1; `NoiseUtils` + C&C Part 1 consumers deferred (see [`../../AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md)) |
| [`03-noise-sampler-settings.md`](03-noise-sampler-settings.md) | `NoiseSampler` + settings (`NoiseSettings`, `NoiseSamplingSettings`) | unit | 3D density field from chunk coords |
| [`04-integration-oracle-harness.md`](04-integration-oracle-harness.md) | **Integration oracle harness**: server-jar runner, MCA reader, chunk-level fixture format | infra | stand up the server-oracle *before* we need to diff chunks |
| [`05-overworld-biome-source.md`](05-overworld-biome-source.md) | `BiomeSource` subset — translated `OverworldBiomeSource` + layered climate pipeline → biome IDs | unit + integration | chunk biomes + `NoiseSampler` inputs now come from a real overworld biome source |
| [`06-noise-based-chunk-generator.md`](06-noise-based-chunk-generator.md) | `NoiseBasedChunkGenerator` (terrain-only: stone/air/water/bedrock; no surface/caves/features) | **integration** | first end-to-end chunk diff against a committed terrain-only Java oracle fixture for the pinned chunk |
| [`06a-pre-07-surface-prep.md`](06a-pre-07-surface-prep.md) | chunk buffer extraction, surface-stage oracle, explicit `buildSurfaceAndBedrock` staging | prep + integration | clear the staging/oracle/storage friction before porting surface builders |
| `07-` | `SurfaceRules` / `SurfaceBuilder` — grass/dirt/sand per biome | integration | visual recognizability |
| `08-` | Carvers: `CaveWorldCarver`, `CanyonWorldCarver` | integration | **MVP terrain gen reached here** |

Everything after 08 (features, ores, structures, aquifers, noodle caves) is post-MVP polish.

## MVP definition

"Recognizable Minecraft overworld" — terrain + carvers + surface rules, no features, no structures, no ores. Rendering a chunk should make you say "oh yeah, Minecraft."
